* You can open it through VSCode (if you have it) or through your Cmd. Ensure your cmd points to the cloned folder.

* Use the command *cd public* to move into the public folder.

* Also, run *npm install* to install your react native and client side dependencies available in the public folder's package.json file.

* Type *npm run dev* and hit your enter button

* When the expo cli is opened, launch the expo app on your smart phone to scan the QR/Barcode to make the application open up.

* Happy Coding....
